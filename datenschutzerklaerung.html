    <strong>Legal bases for processing personal data</strong>
    <p>In the following we will inform you about the legal bases for the processing of personal data:</p>
    <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
        <li>If we have obtained your consent to the processing of personal data, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis.</li>
        <li>If the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, which take place at your request, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO is the legal basis.</li>
        <li>If the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. statutory retention requirements), then Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 lit. c) GDPR is the legal basis.</li>
        <li>If processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 lit. d) GDPR is the legal basis.</li>
        <li>If processing is necessary to safeguard our interests or those of a third party and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail in this regard, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter f) GDPR is the legal basis.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <strong>Disclosure of personal data to third parties and processors</strong>
    <p>In principle, we do not pass on any data to third parties without your consent. If this is the case, then the transfer takes place on the basis of the aforementioned legal bases, e.g. when transferring data to online payment providers to fulfill a
        contract or due to a court order or due to a legal obligation to release the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights.<br /> We also use contract processors (external service providers,
        e.g. for web hosting of our websites and databases) to process your data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of an agreement on order processing, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 DS-GVO. We carefully select our processors,
        check them regularly and have been granted the right to issue instructions regarding the data. In addition, the processors must have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures and comply with the data protection regulations in accordance
        with BDSG nF and DS-GVO</p>

    <br />
    <strong>Data transmission to third countries</strong>
    <p>The adoption of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) created a uniform basis for data protection in Europe. Your data will therefore be processed primarily by companies for which the GDPR applies. Should the processing take place
        by third-party services outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, they must meet the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. This means that the processing takes place on the basis of special guarantees, such as the determination
        of a level of data protection officially recognized by the EU Commission or compliance with officially recognized special contractual obligations, the so-called “standard contractual clauses”. <br />As far as we due to the ineffectiveness of the
        so-called

        <br />
        <strong>Deletion of data and storage period</strong>
        <p>Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as you revoke your consent to processing or the purpose for storage no longer applies or the data are no longer required for the
            purpose, unless because their further storage is required for evidentiary purposes or there are legal storage obligations to the contrary. This includes, for example, commercial law retention requirements for business letters in accordance
            with Section 257 (1) HGB (6 years) and tax retention requirements for receipts in accordance with Section 147 (1) AO (10 years). If the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted,

            <br/>
            <strong>Existence of automated decision-making</strong>
            <p>We do not use automated decision-making or profiling.</p>

            <br/>
            <strong>Provision of our website and creation of log files</strong>
            <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
                <li>If you only use our website for informational purposes (i.e. no registration and no other transmission of information), we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we collect
                    the following data:<br /> IP address;<br /> User's Internet Service Provider;<br /> Date and time of retrieval;<br /> Browser type;<br /> Language and browser version;<br /> Content of the call;<br /> Time Zone;<br /> Access Status/HTTP
                    Status Code;<br /> Amount of data;<br /> Websites the request is coming from;<br /> Operating System.<br /> A storage of this data together with other personal data of yours does not take place.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>This data serves the purpose of providing you with functions and content on our website in a user-friendly, functional and secure manner, as well as optimizing and statistically evaluating them.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in data processing in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>For security reasons, we store this data in server log files for a storage period of days. After this period, they are automatically deleted, unless we need to keep them for evidence purposes in the event of attacks on the server infrastructure
                    or other violations of the law.<br /></li>
            </ol>



            <br/>
            <strong>Execution of contracts</strong>
            <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
                <li>We process inventory data (e.g. company, title/academic degree, names and addresses as well as contact details of users, e-mail), contract data (e.g. services used, names of contact persons) and payment data (e.g. bank details, payment
                    history) for the purpose of fulfilment our contractual obligations (knowledge of who the contractual partner is; justification, content and execution of the contract; checking the plausibility of the data) and services (e.g. contacting
                    customer service) in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 lit b) GDPR . The entries marked as mandatory in online forms are required for the conclusion of the contract.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>This data is generally not passed on to third parties unless it is necessary to pursue our claims (e.g. transfer to a lawyer for debt collection) or to fulfill the contract (e.g. transfer of data to payment providers) or there is a legal
                    obligation to do so in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter c) GDPR.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>We can also process the data you provide to inform you about other interesting products from our portfolio or to send you e-mails with technical information.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. This is the case for the inventory and contract data if the data is no longer required for the execution of the contract
                    and no more claims can be asserted from the contract because they are statute-barred (warranty: two years / standard statute of limitations: three years ). Due to commercial and tax regulations, we are obliged to store your address,
                    payment and order data for a period of ten years. However, if the contract is terminated after three years, we will restrict the processing, ie your data will only be used to comply with legal obligations. Information in the user account
                    remains until it is deleted.<br /><br /></li>
            </ol>

            <br/>
            <strong>Online payment provider</strong>
            <ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">

                    referred to as "Online Calculator". The online billers collect, store and process your usage and billing data to determine and bill for the services you use. The data entered into the online billing service will only be processed and
                    stored by them. If the online billers are unable to collect the usage fees or only partially, or if the online billers fail to do so due to a complaint from you, the usage data will be passed on by the online billers to the person
                    responsible and the person responsible may block it. The same applies if, for example, a credit card company reverses a transaction from you at the expense of the person responsible.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>The legal basis is Art. 6 Paragraph S. 1 lit. b) GDPR, since the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract by the person responsible. In addition, external online billers are used on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence
                    1 Letter f) GDPR for the legitimate interests of the person responsible in order to be able to offer you the safest, simplest and most diverse payment options possible.<br /><br /></li>

                    and, if necessary, to be able to comply with his statutory storage obligations for business letters. If the contact is aimed at concluding a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.<br
